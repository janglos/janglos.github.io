My professional career is centered around two main topics: control system design, and communication networks. 

In each of my [roles](./experience.md), there were additional dimensions - time synchronization, electric vehicles, front-end design, embedded development, data analysis, dynamic simulations, energy optimization, and others.

I've written many scientific and technical [papers](./publications.md) and gave a speech at several events (DefCamp, IEEE conferences, and others).

I'm also providing different [services](./services.md). If you are interested, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
